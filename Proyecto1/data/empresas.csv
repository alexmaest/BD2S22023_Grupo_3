1990-12-30,The Edge,"Edge Games, Inc. is an American video game developer and publisher headquartered in Pasadena, California, best known for the practices of its founder and chief executive officer, Tim Langdell, in enforcing trademarks relating to the word ""edge"", which sources have described as ""litigious"". Langdell has defended these practices, stating that Edge has only sued two companies since the late 1980s.

In 2010, Edge Games sued Electronic Arts for trademark infringement, but eventually settled, with Edge surrendering many of its registrations. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) cancelled the trademarks by court order in April 2013.

History
Edge Games was founded in California in 1990 by Tim Langdell. At that time, it acquired the intellectual property assets of Langdell's former company, Softek Software, itself founded in 1980 in London. Softek's catalog includes several games, such as: Fairlight, released in 1985, and Garfield: Big Fat Hairy Deal, released in 1987. Since the 1989 release of Snoopy and Peanuts Edge Games have released nine games in the last 25 years.

Trademark disputes
Edge Games has been involved in a number of disputes over trademarks connected to the word ""edge"".

Edge (iOS game)
In May 2009, French indie game developer Mobigame had their iOS title Edge removed from Apple's App Store in the US and the UK due to lawsuit threats by Tim Langdell. According to Mobigame, the dispute arose while they were trying to register a trademark for Edge in the US, while Langdell claims he owns the global trademark on ""Edge"".

According to the email dialogue between Langdell and Mobigame head David Papazian, shared with Eurogamer, Langdell delivered an ultimatum to Mobigame in exchange for a promise not to litigate. If they changed the game's name, he demanded 25% of the game's revenue for the time the title was on sale under the name ""Edge"", and if they licensed the Edge name, they would give him 10% of the game's revenue in perpetuity and subtitle it ""An Homage To Bobby Bearing"", with the Edge Games logo on the title screen. Papazian claims that he suggested the alternative title ""Edgy"", but that this was rejected by Langdell for being too similar to ""Edge"". Edge Games subsequently registered ""Edgy"" as a trademark. An Edge Games spokesperson, writing from Tim Langdell's personal email address and signing off as ""Tim Langdell"", claims that their registration was the result of a misunderstanding ""probably in part caused by David Papazian's less than perfect English"". However, many journalists who talked with David Papazian confirmed that Papazian's English is ""absolutely flawless"".

On June 18, 2009, it was reported that the game had been restored to the App Store with its original name intact, though later reports indicated that the game had once again been pulled in July 2009, and Mobigame confirmed that they had voluntarily withdrawn the game while considering their options. Mobigame's lawyer, speaking to Eurogamer, stated that ""Mobigame's position is that the trademarks owned by Edge Games are not enforceable against Mobigame or any third party in respect of the distribution of the Edge game,"" because ""there is unlikely to be any confusion or association between them and Mobigame's game"" and those trademarks ""are liable to be revoked"".

Soon after, Edge Games published an ""open letter"" on its website claiming that several of the statements in the Eurogamer article were false. Mobigame's lawyers issued a response to the effect that the Eurogamer article is accurate and that Edge Games's rebuttal is false, and stated that they were gathering evidence to demonstrate that communications Edge Games claims, in its rebuttal, to have made did not actually occur.

The game was eventually put back on the App Store in UK and US markets on October 7, 2009, under the title Edge by Mobigame. Speaking with Kotaku, Papazian said, ""On the legal side, (Langdell) cannot claim anything against ""Edge by Mobigame"" and Apple knows that, so we hope everything will be alright now.""

On November 26, 2009, Edge by Mobigame was again removed from the App Store. An unnamed Edge Games representative stated ""Adding 'by Mobigame' was determined not to get around infringement."" On December 1, 2009, the game returned to the App Store under the name Edgy, but Mobigame soon removed it for fear that Langdell would use the legal precedent in his legal battle against EA.

In May 2010, the game returned to the App store under the name Edge. Mobigame had the following to say regarding the ongoing legal battle:
""Thanks to us the word ""edge"" is now free to exist on the App Store like on any other marketplace, and games like Mirror's Edge, Shadow Edge, Killer Edge Racing or Edge by Mobigame can live on our iDevices.""

Electronic Arts petition for trademark cancellation
Electronic Arts (EA) petitioned the United Stated Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to cancel a range of registrations associated with Edge Games and Future Publishing on September 11, 2009. EA stated that it had filed the petition because Edge Games had ""continuously"" threatened legal action with respect to the title of EA's 2008 game Mirror's Edge, and that the trademarks had either been obtained by fraud or abandoned through nonuse. Edge Games' Tim Langdell responded that Edge Games had not threatened EA with legal action, and that the two companies had been in amicable settlement talks over EA's use of the mark ""Mirror's Edge"" since late 2008. Langdell added that the 2008 federal court case Edge Games, Inc. v. Velocity Micro, Inc. had ruled that Edge had not obtained any of its trademarks by fraud, nor abandoned them through nonuse. Prior to filing their petition, EA voluntarily abandoned their application for the ""Mirror's Edge"" mark on September 8, 2009.

Edge Games filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against EA over the ""Mirror's Edge"" mark in June 2010. Almost a year later, and after a case in the UK court against Future, Langdell claimed that Edge Games filed the lawsuit against EA at the insistence of its trademark partner Future Publishing. Edge Games charged EA with engaging in willful infringement and unfair competition, and requested damages and a court injunction against further infringement. EA responded with a counterclaim to cancel Edge Games' trademarks, and argued that Edge Games obtained the trademarks based on fraudulent representations to the USPTO including doctored submissions of magazine covers and game boxes. EA added that the trademarks had not been in commercial use at the time of registration. The judge denied Edge Games' request for an injunction in October 2010, stating that Edge Games had abandoned use of its marks, misrepresented its case to the USPTO, and not shown their use of the trademarks to ""legitimately extend beyond trolling various gaming-related industries for licensing opportunities.""

EA and Edge Games reached a settlement in early October, where Edge Games would surrender the trademarks ""edge"" (registered twice), ""cutting edge"", ""the edge"", and ""gamer's edge"". No damages were awarded to EA or Edge Games, and each would pay their own legal fees. The settlement stipulated that neither party admitted fault or wrongdoing and that no party was found guilty of wrongdoing. On October 10, 2010, it was reported that the settlement had been approved by the judge, and a final order had been issued. The USPTO cancelled the five ""Edge"" trademarks on April 9, 2013.

Future Publishing breach
In 2011, it was revealed that Future Publishing, the publisher of game magazine Edge, had brought suit against Langdell in the United Kingdom for breach of contract, breach of copyright, and passing off through the use of the magazine's logo for Edge Games and his representations of his connection with the magazine. Future had licensed the trademark for the use of the word ""Edge"" in magazines from Langdell in 1993, when launching the magazine. The publisher bought the relevant part of the trademark from Langdell outright in 2005. In the intervening years, Future claimed, Langdell had co-opted the magazine's logo as his own, and claimed to have been involved in the creation or publication of the magazine. The action succeeded in all claims, in a decision that described Langdell's own evidence as ""invention"", ""incredible"", ""totally unconvincing"", and ""concocted"".

During the trial, Langdell claimed he invented the Edge logo in 1991, prior to the magazine's launch in 1993, and submitted a floppy disk from 1991 containing a file with the logo. However, Future's expert found the disk's contents were created using Windows 95. The judge summarized: ""Dr Langdell concocted disk 1 in support of his claim that he had invented the EDGE logo in 1991. When this was exposed by the claimant's expert he constructed an elaborate explanation and created disk 3, having learned from the Report how to avoid the mistakes he made the first time.""

In two lengthy missives sent to online games publications, Langdell indicated that he had lodged an appeal, placing the blame for his actions with Future and the responsibility for his loss with a ""gullible"" judge who had made ""almost 100 errors of fact and law"". Future, in turn, indicated that it had not been served with any new proceedings but had received permission to pursue contempt of court proceedings against Langdell.

Edge Games was ultimately denied permission to appeal. Subsequently, the company applied to have Future's UK trademarks assigned to it, with Langdell signing on behalf of both Future Publishing and Edge Games. This application was rejected.

Other
In 2001, Edge Games sought revocation of Namco's United Kingdom trademark ""Soul Edge"" (for the arcade game Soul Edge) for reasons including an alleged similarity between the ""Edge"" and ""Soul Edge"" marks. The opposition failed on all grounds. Nevertheless, Namco had already decided to use the name Soul Blade for the PlayStation version in the United States and Europe to avoid potential complications, with the name Soulcalibur being used on all sequels for the same reason.

In March 2009, Cybernet Systems Corporation filed a lawsuit in Federal court against Edge. In the suit, Cybernet states that they were contacted by Tim Langdell beginning in January 2009 and that he asserted his ownership of the term ""Edge."" The suit also alleges that Langdell asserted his right to have the trademark for Cybernet's ""Edge of Extinction"" game assigned to Edge Games, and his further right to require Cybernet to enter into a paid license agreement with him due to their use of the name. Cybernet refused, and when Langdell threatened a lawsuit, Cybernet instead filed suit against Edge. ""Edge of Extinction"" was released in 2001, and is no longer an active game.

As of June 1, 2009, Edge Games applied for a US trademark for the phrase, ""Edge of Twilight."" This is the name of an upcoming steampunk fantasy game that has been in development by Fuzzyeyes Studios for at least two years.

In addition, Edge Games has been a plaintiff in lawsuits with New World Computing over their title Planet's Edge, Marvel Entertainment over their titles Cutting Edge, Double Edge, and Over the Edge, Sony Entertainment over their PlayStation Edge, Edge Tech Corporation over their ""The Edge"" hardware, and the EdgeGamers online community. Edge Games' website also claims that the aforementioned Marvel comics, the movie The Edge and the games magazine Edge, among other properties, were all released under license from Edge Games, though it is not clear what, if any, involvement Edge Games or Langdell had in these products.

In 2014, Edge Games began a trademark case against the game peripherals company Razer Inc., regarding its Razer Edge gaming tablets. Edge Games filed an application for ""SL8"" in tablets in 2012, serial number 85704825, indicating that it would sell Windows 8 tablets at some point. The application was eventually denied, while Langdell's subsequent attempts to trademark hardware under the ""Edge PC"" name have been suspended.

In July 2009, members of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) began circulation of a petition calling for a special meeting of the membership to vote on the removal of Langdell from that organization's board of directors citing, among other things, his use of his position on the IGDA to ""work directly against the mission of the organization."" In late August, the IGDA announced that a special meeting of the membership would be held on October 3, the sole purpose of which was to vote on whether Langdell should be removed, and on August 31, 2009, Langdell resigned from the IGDA board. Langdell had served on the board since March 2009. In a statement, Langdell said he resigned ""with the best interests of the IGDA at heart"". He stated he was confident that if a quorum was formed the vote would go in his favor, but feared that a quorum would not be attained and the ""vocal minority"" would not accept the outcome and continue to cause further disruption to the IGDA. On October 13, 2010, his IGDA membership was terminated due to his ""...lack of integrity or unethical behavior, as determined by the Board of Directors.""",7253,

The company's first game was Ultima III: Exodus; because of Ultima's established reputation, Origin survived the video game crash that occurred that year. It published many non-Ultima games, and Richard Garriott claimed that he received the same royalty rate as other developers. 
 
By 1988 Origin had 15 developers in Austin, Texas, and 35 other employees in New Hampshire. In September 1992, Electronic Arts acquired the company for $35 million in stock, despite a dispute between the two companies over EA's 1987 game Deathlord. Origin, with about $13 million in annual revenue, stated that it had considered an Initial Public Offering before agreeing to the deal. By 1996, Origin had expanded to more than 300 employees, most of whom were divided among small, largely autonomous development teams. In 1997, Origin released one of the earliest graphical MMORPGs, Ultima Online. After this title, Electronic Arts decided that Origin would become an online-only company after the completion of Ultima IX in 1999. However, within a year's time, in part due to Ultima IX's poor reception, EA canceled all of Origin's new development projects, including Ultima Online 2, Privateer Online, and Harry Potter Online. Richard Garriott left Origin shortly after and founded Destination Games in 2000. 
 
In later years, Origin mainly existed to support and expand Ultima Online and to develop further online games based on the Ultima franchise such as Ultima X: Odyssey, originally to be released in 2004 but later canceled. In February 2004, the studio was disbanded by Electronic Arts. The Longbow series of simulation games was developed at Origin and published under the ""Jane's Combat Simulations"" brand of Electronic Arts. A follow-on project, Jane's A-10, was under development when the project was canceled in late 1998 and the team moved to other projects.",295,1

We are overly enthusiastic about VR and its capabilities, and we want to share that with all the other VR enthusiasts. To share games and concepts with the community, who are very active and hungry for a future where VR feels natural. Of course, we all still have a long way to go, but we have to start somewhere.

The first VR headset we got was a DK1, day 1 from Kickstarter. It was to play games with, which happened. But after a few weeks we saw lots of potential for the future (much like everyone else) and decided to stop playing games (okay maybe just a little bit) and start making games. So, we created a few games here and there, experiences, films etc… And over time we have come up with ways to push VR in the right direction, in the way that we believe is good.",46412,

An idea of a PC game was born and suddenly Oskari found himself running a small team of developers dreaming of INFRA – a first-person puzzle adventure game.

The company Loiste Interactive was established. The young developers figured INFRA should have an intriguing and educational story, while providing intellectual challenge and a rich world for the gamers to immerse themselves in. After some pretty heavy years of development, INFRA was launched in 2016 and the complete set of three parts was to be licensed by the end of 2017.",8033,

Early creations like Super Depth and Sengoku TURB became popular among BBS users, eventually re-releasing in mail order & store shelf compilations. They made many classic, fondly recalled PC-98 freeware games until late in the mid-'90s, at which point the group largely went their separate ways to ASCII, Bandai, and other companies. After their first and last console game, a remake of Sengoku TURB for Dreamcast, Bio_100% officially disbanded.",45821,

,CZG,"CZG is one of the more prominent modder and level designers of the Quake modding scenes, active in the late 90s, up to 2021. He earned his fame for some of the most popular maps and campaigns in the community, including Honey, Disconcerting Unease, Insomnia, Terra, Rubicon2, Aerospace Vitriol and Witch house Mix Tape.

Some of his maps have been re-released in the Quake: Remastered re-release of 2019 with interviews on the Bethesda.net website.

""I remember purchasing an unofficial expansion pack that came with an editor. It was an incredibly obtuse piece of software with practically no documentation and I didn’t have any internet back then. I didn’t manage to create anything worthwhile using that but eventually, I downloaded WorldCraft shareware at school and managed to bring it back home on some floppy discs. A bit later I was introduced to IRC, joined some Quake channels, and spent most of my late teens talking about Quake and mapping with a bunch of weird but wonderful people.""",40821,

2005-12-31,Cohort Studios,"Cohort Studios was a games development and interactive entertainment studio. It was based in Dundee but closed its office there in May 2011.

Formed in 2006, by Lol Scragg, Darran Thomas and Bruce McNeish, Cohort's first project involved being contracted by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe to assist on MotorStorm for PlayStation 3. This was followed with work on Go! Puzzle for PlayStation Network on both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. In addition, the company developed a small downloadable driving title which was used on the website of the Audi TT.

Early in 2008, Cohort Studios released Buzz! Junior: Dino Den for the PlayStation 2 followed later in the year with Buzz! Junior: Ace Racers. Also in 2008, they won the contract for re-developing three of the PS2 Buzz! Junior titles to be distributed via the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3. The titles were to feature 5 of the best mini-games as well as including trophy support and the ability to use a DualShock wireless controller instead of Buzzers.

In October 2010, the company released The Shoot on the PlayStation 3 platform, published by SCEE. The title was one of the first titles to use Sony's new PlayStation Move controller based around the concept of being a movie action hero on a movie set.

On April 21, 2011, Cohort announced that the studio was closing due to ""a declining console marketplace"". Prior to closing Cohort managed to release the two PlayStation minis titles it had been working on namely, Cohort Chess[3] and Me Monstar: Hear me Roar!",45424,

We grow up on playing retro games. Our purpose is to pursue and to evolve more the fun of them.

NIGORO is not a game company. To be exact, NIGORO is a game development department of ASTERIZM corporation. The games are developed by NIGORO members have released as a brand name “NIGORO”. We may also sell on behalf of other game developers. In that case, they have released as a brand name “ASTERIZM”.
It is hard to understand. lol.

In the United States, indie Games has considerable demand, and many developers have been successful. In Japan, when it comes to a genre called “DOUJIN”, there are successes. On the other hand when it comes to a genre called “INDIE”, there are few successes. On top of that, indie games themselves are not so popular.

In that circumstances, we have the ambition to be successful Japanese indie games and hope to boost Japanese indie game development field which like-minded people. We are working with such thoughts. Thanks.""",3909,3912

At one time, having played together a lot of hours in Warcraft, Heroes of Might and Magic, Stronghold, Age of Empires, Civilization, we often discussed with each other the advantages and disadvantages of our favorite games: ""But what if the developers did this or that in such a way, why did they come up with this spell not the other?"" Therefore, having gathered together, we set a goal - to create games in which the cons we saw will not be observed. Our global task is to release a game, plunging into which, we would all solemnly forget about the listed famous series and would only play in it. Of course, “Diplomacy is not an option” is not so large-scale, but for us, it is a step towards our dream.",38132,

2016-04-30,Talecore Studios,"Talecore Studios was founded in late October 2015 by Anna Jenelius, a QA manager who decided to quit her job and go indie. The focus, she decided, would be games with emphasis on narrative and simple but robust design. She already had a small part time project, Capitals, running with Sebastian Alonzo and Markus Hellström - but the time had come to make games with all engines running on full throttle. 

Talecore Studio’s goal is to create experiences that engage the heart and challenge the brain - experiences that make you feel and think. The studio will not hesitate to deal with heavy subjects and more mature themes than you might be used to from other games. Just like literature and movies can range from comedy via the very dark to the thought-provoking, so should games. It is simply a part of the industry showing that it is growing up.",9938,

They have been a popular developer in Japan with games like Photoboy for the PC Engine and In the Hunt for the arcades, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC. Irem is also known for making their arcade games extremely difficult, and most of them feature a dip switch that allows you to play a ""no death mode"" as a result, in order to allow gamers to be able to complete their tough games.

As a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Irem canceled the majority of its remaining video game projects, including Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 4: Summer Memories and Poncotsu Roman Daikatsugeki Bumpy Trot 2. Irem re-focused to become primarily a slot-machine and pachinko developer, the industry it was in before turning to video games. Its video game division was dissolved in April 2011 and many Irem designers, including producer Kazuma Kujo, gathered to form a new company called Granzella to continue creating games.",1287,

2008-12-30,Spiders,"""Spiders is a video game development studio producing its own creations as well as offering part or full productions for third parties.

The company was born when several French video game veterans worked together on the creation of the Silverfall game and its add-on, and decided to pursue the adventure together. Although the company is mainly specialized in the design and development of Action/RPG games, owing to previous experience, it also has the capacity to provide solutions in different genres, like porting.

All of our productions and complete developments use our own multi-platform engine and tool-kit: the Silk Engine.""",405,

Some of our games are available for free on the web. We also produce mobile versions of our games that can be played on iPhones, Android phones, and other mobile devices.

We believe that text-based games are an underutilized format within modern computer games. Just as motion pictures, radio dramas, and television supplement books without rendering them obsolete, similarly modern graphic-based games cover only part of the computer gaming landscape. By using text, we can interact with the imagination in different ways from a graphics-based game. We can also allow game designers to quickly and inexpensively produce games in comparison with graphics-based games.",16347,

community that has so steadfastly stood by their hobby. The Golden 
Age of hardcore PC simulation titles ended long ago. The past few 
years have been lean, with fewer and fewer new products to choose 
from and only a handful of studios dedicated to the genre remain. Most 
major publishers have declared the market dead and unprofitable. We 
at 777 Studios completely reject that notion and believe that the genre 
is still a vibrant place to do business.",2563,

2012-12-30,Pine Studio,"Pine Studio is a small game dev studio from Croatia who started in 2012, in a garage. They have a diverse portfolio, but the project which began it all was a turn based strategy - Perishing Sun. The project was too big of a challenge for the young team, and it was never released. After that, Pine Studio started making smaller mobile games, and they have released over 30 of them by now. Although their specialties are a cute adventure and point 'n click games, their last project is something completely different. SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is the world’s only competitive heavy metal first-person platformer. Like a bastard child of Quake 3 and Super Meat Boy, SEUM: Speedrunners from Hell is truly hardcore and focuses on speed and fast reaction. SEUM was released on Steam July, 2016. Pine Studio is now working on mobile game: Faraway. In Faraway you're an adventurer exploring ruins of ancient temples full of challenges and mysterious puzzles.",10489,

2019-12-31,MoyaGames,"At MoyaGames, every project begins with creativity and the perseverance to bring imaginative concepts to life. This passion for entertainment and virtual immersion gave a young boy in Montreal the idea for an easy-to-control and silly-themed platformer designed with humor in mind.

Through dedication to game development and years of motivation to transform a dream into a reality, MoyaGames was established in Montreal in 2011. Earning attention locally and featured as a promising up-and-coming game developer in the studio's early days, it wasn't until 2022 that MoyaGames began finalizing plans for a 2023 release of our flagship title, Launch the Baby.

With our first game release, MoyaGames has not only set the stage for future games currently in our pipeline, but also achieved a milestone representative of the enthusiasm and joy that we aim to inspire in all of our players for a long time to come.

Collaboration with talent on a global-scale has given MoyaGames the opportunity to enhance the player experience. It's our mission to forge exciting content, rich stories, and vast worlds that our players will want to revisit over and over again.",46858,

2007-10-06,11 bit studios,"11 bit studios, based in Warsaw, Poland, is a multiplatform game development studio selling games worldwide. Our titles have received multiple prestigeous awards throughout the years including: Apple Design Award, Best of PAX and IGN Editor's Choice.

It all started in 2009, when a bunch of veterans of polish gaming industry joined their forces and founded 11 bit studios. They gathered few talented people and got to work. After a year our first child was born – Anomaly Warzone Earth hit the stores. Quickly it became a huge success, with great sales and number of industry awards, including Apple Design Award.

It was a proof that we were on the right track and in the next few years we repeated the success with Anomaly 2, Anomaly Korea and few other games. But you know what they say – the more you have, the more you want so in 2012 we decided it was time for something bigger.

For the next two years we worked on our upcoming title. Bigger and better than ever before, but what’s even more important – a game that had a potential to touch people. A game that could matter. Something, that hasn’t been done before. A thing to be played and discussed for years to come. In the end of 2014 we were ready and our greatest achievement to this day had it’s premiere. On 14th of November This War of Mine had its release and everything had changed.

The cost of development were covered in first weekend after the premiere, and since then the game keeps being one of the topsellers on Steam and other distribution platforms. The game got over 100 awards and was covered as a phenomenon in the biggest magazines and newspapers all around the world including TIME, EDGE, Washington Post and more.

This brings us to the place where we are today. This War of Mine is still selling really well, being one of the most successful indie titles of the last decade. Our next big game, Frostpunk, is right around the corner and you know what? Again our guts are telling us it will leave a mark. We are crossing the borders and redefining the rules of the genre and that’s the road we want to follow. We believe in creating things instead of just copying them.

Soon you’ll tell us if we achieved what we hoped for. In the meantime we are not slacking around – we started a publishing program that allows developers from all around the world to release their indie games with our help. The first games are already out there, so you should check them out.

That’s our story so far, but we are quite sure there is more to come.",4133,

In the beginning it was the job of one person just making an RPG that he loved and could play. The studio was born with the not-so-humble intention of creating games that we wanted to play, but didn't see in the current market anymore.

We are storytellers. We want to tell stories in the best possible way. We have good friends and third-party companies that help us on this journey of shaping our ideas and turning our ideas into games.

We have new games that continue to come out of the oven, in addition to our relationship with the real estate market that gave birth to the Metahouse project. Currently, our efforts are in producing original RPG, ARPG, Survival Horror, Action and Platform games for PC, Consoles and mobile.

We love to create and we want to dare to leave our marks on the world.",28408,

1988-07-27,Simis,"Founded in 1988 by four colleagues from the simulator research team at British Aerospace, SIMIS advanced the art of flight simulator games significantly through a deep understanding of aerospace engineering, physics and computer science.

Interdictor marked the studios first release in 1989 and is credited as the first flight simulator to be released for the Acorn Archimedes. A sequel to Interdictor was released in 1991 and is remembered as one of the first flight simulators to ever feature 3D terrain, utilising the powerful new ARM processors of the day. Interdictor 2 was built with a complete set of proprietary object and world building tools, which later went on to find a life of their own as Flight Sim Toolkit, a pioneering piece of software that gave flight sim fans the tools to create a game of their own.

In 1995, founders Jonathan Newth and Ian Baverstock lead the sale of their games division to Domark, retaining a division of Simis focused on medical imaging. Following the sale, Simis, with Eidos Technologies, Domark and Big Red Software, formed the Eidos Interactive Group.

Jonathan and Ian would continue to run Simis as an in-house development studio of Eidos until 1998 when together, they would lead a management buyout of the studio from Eidos Interactive for just £1 and rename the studio Kuju Entertainment.

Kuju Entertainment went on to release a number of pioneering games including the original Microsoft Train Simulator in 2001, a game whose focus on actively supporting user created content can be traced back to Simis’ Flight Sim Toolkit. Kuju eventually became Europe’s largest external game development studio.",6232,4

2016-12-30,Greatest Bear Studios,"Greatest Bear Studios is an independent video game development team established in 2016, consisting of artist/animator blazing cheeks, writer/coder Ursa Maximus, and musician/recording engineer Fann. We sprang out of the furry scene, which remains a strong but not exclusive influence on our work.

Our focus is creating adult video games that feature uncompromising, explicit gay sexual content without skimping on quality of graphics, gameplay, or sound. We hope that our games awaken something new in even the kinkiest of our players.

After the release of the (award winning?, really?!) Strange Flesh in 2017, we began exploring new technology platforms, themes, and gameplay styles before kicking off development of our next project in earnest mid-2018. It will be announced when we are ready, and released when it's done.

Programmer by day and erotic game programmer by night, Ursa Maximus is acting project manager and lead developer for Greatest Bear. He also writes erotica, bakes, bikes, creates electronic art installations, and occasionally even plays a video game. He lives in Boston, Massachusetts, USA with his husband.",46671,

2015-12-30,Gamedust,"Gamedust studio are game developers who emerged from the Poznań software house Setapp. What motivated the creation of the studio was the desire to create unique games. The origins of these dreams go back to the execution of orders for external companies. Gamedust was created in order to create unusual, original and entertaining titles for players.

The studio's adventure with VR technology began with the logical, disturbing title Neverout. In Neverout, the player tries to escape from a huge cube-shaped prison. To do this, we solve logical puzzles and play with perspective switching. The early audience of virtual reality games liked the idea very much, evoking associations with escape rooms. The studio's next title was the hit Overflight. In this game, we sit at the controls of a combat plane and fight opponents in the realities of the Second World War. In addition to the campaign, there was also a multiplayer mode. Gamers around the world have come to love Overflight and it has made Gamedust a really good reputation.

The third VR game that Gamedust has prepared is Spuds Unearthed. It was a very comedic production with lovely Spuds. Real-time strategy, arcade game and multiplayer are combined here. Despite the very good graphics, the idea turned out to be too complicated, unreadable and it did not meet the expectations of the players.

After this difficult lesson, Gamedust returned to its roots and created a game based on simple, but original and very refined mechanics. Yupitergrad follows the adventures of a brave cosmonaut repairing a space station and moving around it in a Spider-Man web-slinging style. The polished, fun and very addictive game instantly became one of the most interesting games in the Oculus Quest catalog, as well as other VR platforms. Gamedust supports this title and develops it with subsequent updates.",15666,

It was relaunched as a quarterly A5 magazine in December 2020 with the backing of the original founders.

The magazine was launched to cater for the booming Spectrum games market. It was immediately popular owing to its quality of writing and distinctive, though occasionally controversial, artwork created by Oliver Frey. By 1986 it had become the biggest-selling British computer magazine with over 100,000 copies sold monthly, but struggled towards the end of the decade after other magazines put cassettes of games on the front cover. In the 2010s, a number of retrospective issues were created via a kickstarter campaign leading to the new publication by Fusion Retro",45831,

Founded in Tokyo March 1st 2005, but then after 10 years of operation went bankrupt in September 25th 2015. 
 
The founder company of QuinRose brand, developer studio. 
 
While it is a Publisher and Developer at the same time all games it published had only developer studio logo in them, with Artmove mentioned only in text format. For this reason it is probably not widely associated in public with QuinRose brand games. 
 
Company was mainly publishing Visual Novels for female demographic. At first for PCs, then solely on consoles, PSP and PS Vita. It has also been selling vocal song albums and accessories associated with their games. 
 
Their bankruptcy was pretty sudden and controversial, as it is rumored that they did not pay out developers for their work. Just a few days before bankruptcy was announced they managed to publish their last game, which was Genji Koiemaki for PS Vita, on September 17th 2015. Other titles already planned for release got canceled. Reason for their bankruptcy as stated by company itself was a change in mobile games market, which caused poor sales of their games, which already had a small receiving audience to begin with. 
 
On June 6th 2019 during Otomate Party 2019 event in Japan, different company, Otomate, owned by Idea Factory, announced that it has acquired licence rights for QuinRose brand, renaming it to QuinRose reborn (for otomate) and hiring a few of it's original developers. At the same time two new titles, a continuation of the most popular of QuinRose game series Kuni no Alice, were announced. The two are スペードの国のアリス ～Wonderful White World～ (Spade no Kuni no Alice ~Wonderful White World~ and スペードの国のアリス ～Wonderful Black World～ (Spade no Kuni no Alice ~Wonderful Black World~) for Nintendo Switch.",24336,

1982-12-30,System 3 Software,"Formed in 1982 by Mark Cale, System 3 is recognised as one of the founding pioneers of the gaming industry and as a name synonymous with producing original genre defining gaming concepts year on year. System 3 stands proud as the last surviving British Independent Publisher from those grass roots years

2012 marked System 3′s 30th anniversary, a monumental occasion in the company’s long and fruitful history!

From early 8-bit Commodore 64 and the Sinclair Spectrum machines, through the days of 16-bit Commodore Amiga and Atari ST formats right up to and beyond the phenomenal Sega, Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox console boom, the company has brought a unique gaming style to new formats as and when they enter the market.

In the mid 1980′s International Karate was a huge hit, attaining global recognition as the first game from a European publisher to hit the number one spot in the prestigious US Billboard Charts. What followed is true gaming folklore. Hailed as the most original series of games for a generation The Last Ninja and Last Ninja 2 set the standard in arcade adventuring, hitting number one around the world and garnering the company with armfuls of awards by the turn of the decade. Making up the final part of the historic trilogy Last Ninja 3 became the only game to date to be awarded a 100% review in Commodore User Magazine.

As the market began to lean more and more towards licenses and franchises, Myth: History in the Making, Putty Squad and Constructor continued to showcase System 3′s development ethos for producing truly original gaming experiences for everyone.

In 2007 System 3 entered into an agreement with Ferrari, the worlds most prestigious and instantly recognisable car brand. With one eye on producing a super-slick original racing game befitting the name and another on developing the definitive race game engine, Ferrari Challenge: Trofeo Pirelli was born.

A critical success and widely regarded as the best racing simulation available today, the game has gone on to form the bedrock of ongoing plans to continue to produce original games for all genres and, in particular, technically superior video racing games for many years to come.

In 2010 System 3 began the process of welcoming back one of its most popular IPs; Putty. Putty Squad is set for release on PS3, Vita and Apple formats in 2013.

System 3 produces games for the key hardware platforms including; Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PSP go, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 306, Windows-based personal computers and mobile phone applications.",1234,

1988-12-30,Camerica,"Camerica was a company owned and operated by David J. Harding. It was a video game company that was notable for producing unlicensed Nintendo Entertainment System games and hardware. It was founded in 1988 and published games through 1992. It created a number of peripherals for the NES, including the Aladdin Deck Enhancer. Camerica had the rights to publish most of Codemasters' game titles, both on the NES and the Deck Enhancer. Thor Aackerlund was a spokesperson for the brand.

Camerica created many early peripherals for the NES, such as Supersonic The Joystick, a wireless controller add-on.[1] However, they soon let their license expire for unknown reasons, while leaving many of these products on the market. Nintendo sued Camerica and their USA distributor, Galoob Toy, many times. Camerica and Galoob Toy prevailed every time. There were lawsuits in California, New York and Canada. Nintendo had to pay Galoob Toy USD$15,000,000 in damages over one of those lawsuits.

Since Camerica still lacked license to produce NES games, they had to create their own cartridges that would bypass Nintendo's lock-out chip. Like the circuit used in Color Dreams cartridges, the Camerica lock-out defeat generated glitch pulses that froze the chip. The cartridges they made were shaped slightly differently from Nintendo's cartridges, though they still fit in the NES. The most notable difference however was in color: all Camerica cartridges were gold and later silver. They also featured a switch for play on European NES consoles.

Camerica released the Codemasters-designed Game Genie in Canada and the UK.",1270,

He focuses on making accessible games and playful things inspired by art, culture and human interest. His games are not about skills or high-scores. They are about relaxing, reflecting, playful tinkering, and being absorbed into the story & aesthetics (nowadays often referred to as ‘wholesome’).

In the past Thomas did collaborations in the field of serious gaming, AR and VR but ‘Please, Touch The Artwork’ is Thomas’s first full-solo project and has received several awards and international nominations.",40059,

2014-12-30,Renegade Game Studios,"Renegade was founded in 2014 in San Diego, CA by industry veteran Scott Gaeta. Scott's over 20 years of experience enabled Renegade to gain a foothold immediately, releasing award-winning products and igniting a new era of casual games. 
 
Scott entered the industry on the retail side, opening a game store in 1996. The store flourished in the golden age of CCGs, and later expanded into minis and board games. From there he starting consulting for Decipher, cutting his teeth on popular products such as the Star Wars, Star Trek, and Lord of the Rings CCGs. Scott eventually sold his store and became Decipher's Senior Vice President. Years later, he moved to Upper Deck Entertainment as Senior Director, tackling tabletop products based on Yu-Gi-Oh!, DC Comics, World of Warcraft, Marvel Comics, Hello Kitty and more. 
 
After a great run at both companies, Scott decided it was time to build a game company from the ground up. In 2010, Scott co-founded Cryptozoic Entertainment with his partners. The company exploded onto the scene, with products ranging from World of Warcraft CCG expansions to various licensed tabletop games. In 2014, Scott decided to leave the company he co-founded and move on to a new challenge of bringing hobby quality games to the masses. Scott founded Renegade Game Studios in 2014.",13091,

1993-12-30,Waixing,"Fuzhou Waixing Computer Science & Technology Co. Ltd. (Chinese: 福州外星电脑科技有限公司) currently known as Waixing Education Technology and sometimes Waixing Technology (外星科技) is a Chinese company known for making unlicensed Famicom games and other electronics. The company was founded on November 18, 1993. As well as originally developed games, they also released Chinese translations of Japanese games under their own name, for example, Fire Emblem.

Atop of this, Waixing also developed games built into various consoles since somewhere around 2005 - including those developed by Subor and Macro Winners - notably for various Wii clones such as the Zone 40 and MiWi. Some are Famicom-based (either standard Famiclone hardware, or VR Technology hardware with an enhanced colour palette) while others use certain 16-bit or 32-bit architectures. Some of these games were developed by Nice Code Software, Cube Technology, and possibly JungleTac, but feature Waixing copyrights on their title screens. In the case where additional changes were made to these games when released elsewhere, including those of the Nice Code library, they would usually have different title screens, graphics, or even an entirely new set of music.

Nowadays, Waixing has finished Famicom development (although their TMall site has their FC library available) and now manufactures Wii clones and educational software.",36098,

The holding company was created in 2008 when the main Japanese company, SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD., was split into a pure holdings company and a separate succeeding business taking over all previous rights and obligations. 
 
This was done by renaming the original company as a holdings company and creating a new business with the original name to take over all ongoing work. This process leaves most operations unchanged while creating a separate company for shareholders without interrupting normal business operations.

1996-12-31,Piranha Bytes,"Piranha Bytes are developers of computer games located in the Ruhrgebiet, Germany’s industrial heartland. They have developed the much acclaimed GOTHIC, Risen, and ELEX computer roleplaying games.

Pluto 13 GmbH was founded in 2002 by employees and management of Piranha Bytes Software GmbH. Piranha Bytes Software GmbH was itself founded in 1997 and later (1999) turned into a 100% subsidiary of Phenomedia AG, a company listed on Germany’s Neuer Markt stock exchange. In 2001 the first GOTHIC game was released to the public. In May 2002 Phenomedia AG went into insolvency proceedings due to irregularities for which several former group managers (not Piranha Bytes’ management!) have been tried for in a German criminal court of law.

It was therefore decided to make a clean cut and negotiate an MBO with the administrator, which was concluded in September 2002. Pluto 13 GmbH was founded and major assets, trademarks and most staff were transferred to the new company. One of the four original founders remained with the team in a leading position.

Pluto 13 GmbH is a privately owned limited liability corporation under German law, all shares were held by its staff and management.

In 2019 Piranha Bytes were fully acquired by THQ Nordic and reincorporated into Piranha Bytes GmbH. Staff and management remained unchanged. Current permanent staff is around 30 people - all but of one doing active development (designers, programmers, scripters, artists...).",1056,10075

Ever since, we played video games every day (if we could help it). As time passed, we got really good at playing games, and loved the really challenging games. Growing up we loved to play games like Mortal Kombat Mythologies Subzero, Berzerk, Star Wars Shadows of the Empire, and Crash Bandicoot 2, but of course the list goes on. Thanks to our parents, who would force us to go outside to do something unrelated to the TV, we also really liked to ride dirt bikes, go for hikes, camp, and swim. Needless to say, we spend almost all our time together, so usually running into one of us means getting the 2 for 1 special. Eventually we both started making games together, though they were usually pretty bad at first, they taught us all we needed to know to begin creating a real game.",14925,

The studio worked as a sub-contractor on a number of titles before moving onto its first unique project, Sony-published retro shooter Gravity Crash, in 2008. PS3 and PSP versions released in 2009/2010.

JAW went on to sign a far-reaching contract with Lorne Lanning’s Oddworld Inhabitants to develop properties in the Oddworld franchise, a move Gilray describes as a “turning point”. Oddworld: Stranger’s Wrath HD, a conversion of the 2005 original, released in 2010 for PC then a year later for PS3, then followed in 2012 for PlayStation VITA.

Towards the end of development on Stranger’s Wrath HD, the team moved over to start development on what would become Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty for PS4, Xbox One, PS3, VITA, PC, Mac and Linux.

Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty launched in July 2014 on PS4 to critical acclaim, with other platforms arriving in the months following. The title did well to beat its own 12 month sales prediction within 2 months of release.

The team also revisited their title Gravity Crash, by creating a PlayStation VITA version titled Gravity Crash Ultra, released in August 2014. 2014 and 2015 has seen JAW work with new Partners and Clients.

The team are incredibly proud of the titles they’ve worked on, as they have received critical acclaim, achieving metacritic scores in excess of 80.",728,

Made by gamers for gamers, Rune is built upon a standardized, fair, open and extensible framework for random item generation, player-to-player transactions, and in-game rewards. This framework is open to third-party developers that want to incorporate the same technology in their own gaming experiences.

Imagine a digital game world where you have real ownership, control and impact. You have developed your skill & knowledge, and are now rewarded for your effort.

Our goal is for rewards to feel meaningful, and provide an income for at least 1% of our most talented/hard working players.

There will only ever be 33 Runes and each have different utility in the Rune Metaverse. Runes can be used to unlock specific features, or for crafting items. Players are then rewarded runes by winning games or finding them randomly in the game.",40691,

2022-12-10,iGP Games,"iGP Games was founded in 2011 by Jack Basford after pursuing a career as a racing driver. In 2008, Jack won a talent search looking for a future Formula One driver. The competition was set to be televised, until the rights changed hands at the conclusion of the competition, and the new rights holder dropped the show. The promised prize, a fully paid season in Formula BMW, vanished overnight. This setback led Jack to shift focus and pursue his passion for technology, learning software development, business, game design and more, mostly by reading.
After explaining his vision for iGP Manager to a friend, they moved in to a cramped flat and begin building it, hiring any extra help they needed using loans. Launched in December 2011 as a browser game, iGP Manager was the first of its kind, offering real-time multiplayer strategy. A loyal community grew around the title, which would later reach new heights when it became cross-platform.
By 2017 iGP Manager arrived in the app stores, where it went on to amass an audience of millions of players around the world. 2021 marked the addition of 3D graphics and wheel-to-wheel racing, making iGP Manager the first game in the genre to offer onboard and TV cameras, comparable to a racing game. To this day, it remains one-of-a-kind in the app stores, offering an experience and visuals normally reserved for desktop titles. One of the largest games of its kind to this day, with an ambitious team behind it, fully embracing remote work, iGP Games remains a fully independent studio. Jack is also the sole remaining founder, having persisted through the early startup years.",42414,

1998-11-08,Loki Software,"Loki Entertainment Software, Inc. was a video game developer based in Tustin, California, United States, that ported several video games from Microsoft Windows to Linux. It took its name from the Norse deity Loki.

Although successful in its goal of bringing games to the Linux platform, the company eventually closed due to financial troubles, with it declaring Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in August 2001 and finally being disbanded in January 2002.

Excerpt from their archived website:
""Loki Entertainment Software contracts with successful computer entertainment software companies to port their best selling titles to Linux. A freeware Unix-like operating system, Linux has been dubbed the only true competitor to Windows and has established a solid following in the United States and abroad. Gaming software is an untapped segment of the Linux market with significant potential.

Unlike commercial operating systems developed solely for profit, Linux truly represents the ""power of the people."" Created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish developer, and made available for free over the Internet, Linux is continually being enhanced by thousands of volunteer developers and programmers around the globe. New capabilities are routinely shared and contributed as software developers have molded the versatile operating system to fit their company's specific needs. While most commercial operating systems go through five to seven revisions per year, Linux might see multiple revisions in a day. There is a virtually unlimited and growing pool of talent supporting the product.

Loki Entertainment Software was founded in August, 1998 with the goal of bringing a broad range of games to Linux. Loki generates revenues for game publishers by bringing proven hits to this significant, new market. Just as Hollywood studios are able to supplement profits by re-releasing movies to video, pay-per-view and international markets, the ports developed by Loki enable publishers to generate additional revenues from existing products without incurring additional costs.

For Linux users, Loki brings best selling games, fully supported and sold through traditional retail channels -- something the Linux community has been lacking until now. We are very proud of our commitment to Linux, and are excited about bringing a rich gaming experience to our platform of choice.""",106,

,Crozza Remakes,"About me

Born in the Northeast of england on june 25th 1957 (Yep I'm an old git) who made my living as a joiner on the building sites until around 2006.

My Hobby

As you have probably noticed from the downloads on this site that I love to make and play retro games from the early 80's onwards which included computer and game consoles.

I remember my very first computer it was the ZX81 which didn't have the graphics like today but used the ascii characters and took an age to load the games. Then came the ZX spectrum, vic 20, Amstrad CPC and last of all was my beloved Atari ST before getting into the pc I also had a couple of consoles the Atari 2600, coleco and megadrive up to PSP which was my last.

Playing Emulated retro games is fun and helps me to get to know the games that I re-make and also they bring back fond memories of those early gaming days. There are emulators for just about every computer and game console ever made and 1000's of games to download and play.

I make my games for fun not for profit using Gamemaker from yoyogames.com which is really easy to get to grips with. All of my games are made with earlier versions of Gamemaker which need DIRECTX installed

starting from version 5/7 up to 8 as they create smaller files than the latest Gm Studio (Hey if it ain't broke don't fix it).

Anyway nuf said instead of just playing games why not try making them too it's a lot more fun and rewarding too.

So download the games which are all portable just unzip and run no installation and all (Free gratis and for nothing with no add-ons or extras ) and Have fun.

Feel free to distribute any of my free games on your site as long as you do not charge for them and a link to my site would be nice.

take a look at some of the older versions of Gamemaker that still work today

Link GM Programs

Most of my games are on Gamejolt.com please comment or report any game problems via that site.

Finally, the group would be made up of Ariza himself, two childhood friends (Juan Carlos Naranjo and José Antonio Martín) with whom he had previously collaborated, and Gustavo Tallón (creator of the advertisement published in the magazine).

The team's name makes a nod to a film of the time (CreepShow), their first project being a game with an underwater theme, using a technique similar to that of Cyberum, from Ultimate. The game was presented to Dinamic as the only desired option with ""Rescue Atlantis"" the first Creepsoft published game.",14961,

1979-12-30,Strategic Simulations,"When wargame giant Avalon Hill and then-current computer game publishers were not interested in his first title, Joel Billings had to found his own company to publish and distribute his computer wargames. SSI was the dominant force in computer wargames from then (1981) into the early 1990s, holding its own against Avalon Hill's own efforts and other competitors. 
 
In the mid 1980s, two of SSI's more prolific developers left to form their own company, SSG. The split appears to have been at least as much a result of the two living in Australia as of any business or creative reasons. 
 
In the late 1980s, SSI signed a deal with TSR, Inc., to publish official Dungeons and Dragons computer games. The ""Gold Box"" D&D games took the company in new directions. Although SSI never stopped publishing war games, the D&D license quickly became the main source of income and produced their best-known products. 
 
The loss of the D&D license to Interplay was the swan song for SSI as an independent company. No longer dominant in their original wargame market and suddenly without their primary franchise, the company was acquired by Mindscape in 1994. It changed hands several times after that - from Mindscape to The Learning Company, Mattel Interactive, The Gores Group and finally to Ubi Soft. Ubi Soft used the SSI logo and name on some of their titles, including Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor and Destroyer Command, but has since retired the brand.",1486,

2004-06-30,Clover Studio,"Clover Studio was an independent Japanese video game development studio funded by Capcom. It consisted largely of existing Capcom R&D talent, who had formed the company to give themselves greater executive control (and thus creative freedom), like Sega's semi-autonomous studios in the early 2000s. The studio focused largely on creating new intellectual property rather than sequels. When these failed to perform on par with Capcom's more popular series, Capcom attempted to merge the studio back into their internal R&D. Those at the studio chose instead to leave the company, and Clover was dissolved. Some of the key members of Clover founded Seeds Inc., a new development group that merged with ODD Incorporated in October 2007 to form PlatinumGames, which has since built up a staff composed of former Clover staff. Other members (including the art director of Ōkami) went to join Ignition Entertainment at their Tokyo development studio.",2055,37

1996-12-30,Gee Whiz! Entertainment,"Gee Whiz! Entertainment was a development studio based in Brisbane, Australia. It was formed in 1996 by the partners John Passfield and Steve Stamatiadis, as a continuation of the studio Interactive Binary Illusions they had established in 1993. Both founders have an extensive background in comic books.

Following up on the games Alien Carnage (also known as Halloween Harry) in 1993, and Flight of the Amazon Queen in 1995, they released Zombie Wars as a Windows sequel to Alien Carnage in 1998. After that, they attempted to redesign their cancelled project Stereo Jack completely in 3D in 1998, but did not complete it. In 1999 they developed a type of software they coined Screen Opera. The first one developed was Magic Spirit Board (2000), followed by The Chronicles of Jaruu Tenk (2000). It was an attempt at creating a living, persistent world similar to the one from David Crane's Little Computer People (1985) on the Commodore 64.

In Chronicles, you got to explore the world of a little alien called Jaruu Tenk. He was an Observer on the small island of Bloofen Jut. The software was time based and each time you visited Jaruu more things would appear in his world. He even updated his journal everyday and got the newspaper delivered daily. You could also talk to him by typing on the keyboard. Chronicles could be set up as a screen saver and when it kicked in you would return to Jaruu’s world reflecting the time of your visit – morning, day or night. His friends would also pop by for a visit and he’d engage them in conversation. Leading up to Christmas he'd even set up a Christmas tree. It took over a year to put together, work being done at night and on weekends in between developing the Mike Stewart's Pro Bodyboarding game (1999). The Screen Opera project was never meany purely commercially, unlike the first The Sims game by Maxis that was released around the same time.

By 1999, the studio formed a joint-venture with a company owned by Robert Walsh, who had produced Mike Stewart’s Pro Bodyboarding, and it became Krome Studios Pty Ltd.",47761,

2001-12-30,Raw Thrills,"Raw Thrills, Inc. is an arcade game entertainment company based in Skokie, Illinois. It is best known for developing arcade games based on films.

Raw Thrills was founded in 2001 by Eugene Jarvis, Deepak Deo, and Andrew Eloff. The staff also consists of other former Midway Games employees. Currently the staff runs around 25 employees, most of whom have been with the company for the majority of its existence.

Early on, the company made games for IGT including Super Times Pay Poker, Multi-Play Blackjack, and Turbo Reelette with later games involving modifications of the Super Times Pay engine.

Raw Thrills' first independent coin-op game was Target: Terror, a light-gun shooter game which was later upgraded to Target: Terror Gold (also known as Target: Force) featuring bonus levels, end-of-round awards, and other performance enhancements. Target: Terror was the first gun game designed under the direction of Eugene Jarvis.

Cruis 'n Blast arcade cabinets, released by Raw Thrills in 2017
The company's second game was The Fast and the Furious, a racing game based on the Universal Studios movie of the same name. Tsunami Visual Technologies later made a motion version of the game for large family entertainment centers.

In 2006, Raw Thrills published two titles: Big Buck Hunter PRO, developed by Play Mechanix; and The Fast and the Furious: Super Bikes. Raw Thrills released in 2007 a sequel to The Fast and the Furious titled The Fast and the Furious: Drift. They also released a continuation of the successful Big Buck series, Big Buck Safari in three different configurations which included a standard 27"" cabinet, a 42"" LCD version and an 8'x6' projected screen Theater version. They would also release a new update to Big Buck Hunter Pro with Big Buck Hunter Pro: Open Season in 2009.

After the success of their Fast and Furious DRIFT racing title, the company set their sights on kart-style racing with Nicktoons Nitro. The game featured licensed characters from various Nickelodeon cartoon shows including SpongeBob SquarePants, Timmy Turner, Avatar Aang, Invader Zim, Jimmy Neutron, and Danny Phantom.

Also in 2009, Raw Thrills teamed up with Konami and Activision to produce Guitar Hero Arcade. Raw Thrills engineered the game while Konami and Activision were involved to cover patenting and licensing issues respectively. The game was a solid success selling over 2000 units in just three months.

In January 2009, it was revealed that Raw Thrills and Specular Interactive came together to produce a spiritual successor to the Midway arcade racer Hydro Thunder with a game entitled H2Overdrive. Specular Interactive was made up of several ex-Midway employees who had worked on Hydro Thunder and this led to H2Overdrive maintaining many of the ideas that Hydro Thunder had in place while adding in some new elements such as achievements, a leveling up system and improved physics. It also received high praise from critics. The original version of H2Overdrive came in a cabinet sporting a 42"" LCD HD monitor and in March 2010 they produced a 32"" version for smaller venues. A motion-based version was also produced in November 2009 that was being handled by Namco Bandai Games and UNIS. UNIS also holds the rights to distribute the game in China.

In March 2010, Raw Thrills and Play Mechanix released Terminator Salvation, a deluxe light-gun shooter based upon the film of the same name that was released to theaters in May 2009. The game received early praise from arcade operators as it exceeded earnings expectations during testing.",2312,

Stern's first arcade game was the internally developed Berzerk. Along with the Konami-developed imports Scramble and Super Cobra Stern quickly established themselves as one of the major arcade companies in the United States outside of Atari, Midway and Williams.

A combination of internal issues and the video game market crash eventually forced the closure of Stern Electronics in 1984.

2005-12-30,4A Games,"4A Games is a video game development studio known for its atmospheric first person shooters Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light. The studio was established in 2005 by experienced game industry professionals with the aim of creating premium quality games for latest generation consoles and personal computers. All our experience, talent and enthusiasm go into creating games with deep story, unique gameplay elements and highly detailed believable environments.

Creative Director Andrey Prokhorov has this to say about the studio: 
“The Ukrainian game development industry was formed from self-taught people, enthusiasts who learned by trial and error. Coming from various backgrounds – engineers, musicians, movie directors, painters, scientists and even the military - this diversity gives our studio a certain uniqueness in the way we create games. All new people are carefully selected to fit perfectly into the team. We never pursue quantity to the prejudice of quality, and the smaller size of our studio allows for a unique creative process in a friendly atmosphere.”",314,

After they graduated from university, there were very few interactive design agencies in China – they considered it as a good chance and founded Spotlightor Interactive. After 4 years' hard working in the interactive design area, Spotlightor grew up into a small and professional interactive design studio. 
 
After that - Indie games 
Gao Ming decided to devote himself to game design career before he entered university. In the first 4 years of Spotlightor, he kept making game prototypes during free time, participating in Ludum Dare game jams, and embedding game elements in commercial interactive design projects. After 4 years, Spotlightor had gained enough experience through commercial projects and some money to start indie projects – it was time to chase another dream, a dream of indie games. In 2013, Spotlightor started a plan called “Crazy Friday” – each Friday, we stopped all commercial projects and made indie games instead. Since then, Spotlightor started its journey of indie games.

1993-12-30,Digital Extremes,"Founded in 1993 by James Schmalz, Digital Extremes Ltd. proudly ranks as one of the world's top development studios in the interactive entertainment industry.
Headquartered in London Ontario, Canada’s 10th largest city, Digital Extremes got its foothold early on in the game industry during the shareware craze of the early 90s. Epic Pinball was a ten month project written entirely in assembly language by Schmalz that went on to become one of the most successful shareware games ever made, trailing only behind such industry greats as Duke3D, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Sequels such as Silverball and Extreme Pinball were released shortly thereafter and together they helped fund the creation of what would become one of the industry’s blockbuster franchises, Epic Games’ Unreal®.

Beginning in 1994, Digital Extremes partnered with Epic Games (at that time, its shareware publisher) and co-created Unreal and its counterpart Unreal Tournament. Both games set new standards for first-person action games and broke new ground in online multiplayer gaming. Tremendously rich graphics, fine-tuned gameplay, frenetic action and high quality production value are descriptions that have become synonymous with any Unreal branded game. To date, the award-winning Unreal franchise, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship has sold more than 12 million units worldwide across the PC, PlayStation®2, Xbox™ and Dreamcast™ platforms.

Digital Extremes completed development on its original IP for the current generation of consoles, Dark Sector®, which shipped to stores in 2008, using its proprietary next-gen technology, the Evolution Engine™. Following its success, the studio expanded to two teams to allow for simultaneous development on separate projects.

Digital Extremes completed work on the Multiplayer component of 2K Games’ blockbuster, Bioshock® 2 as well as the PC version of THQ hit, Homefront™.  The company also recently ventured into the mobile world with the release of Retro Pinball for Apple’s iOS platform, a throwback to the company’s roots.  More recently, Digital Extremes earned critical acclaim for the development of first-person action game, The Darkness® II, based on the comic book series of the same name.  In addition, the company assisted Microsoft with additional multiplayer content to Halo®4.  The studio is currently developing and publishing the Free-to-Play action game, Warframe",17,

1987-03-30,Bullfrog Productions,"Bullfrog Productions was a British developer. It was founded in 1987 by Les Edgar and Peter Molyneux. They were best known for their strategy god games such as Populous.

In January 1995, to strengthen its global positioning, Bullfrog Productions merged with long time publishing partner Electronic Arts. In August 1997, Bullfrog co-founder, Peter Molyneux, left to establish a new development team, Lionhead Productions (who, incidentally, has also signed a distribution deal with Electronic Arts). In September 1999, Les Edgar changed his role to consultant for Bullfrog Productions Limited, enabling him to pay more equitable attention to his other business interests. Edgar handed the reins to Bruce McMillan from Electronic Arts' Canadian studio.

Following its purchase by EA, Bullfrog continued to work in its original offices in Guildford as an EA studio, and continued to display its own Bullfrog logo on the boxes of its games. In 2000, Electronic Arts merged its EA-UK offices, which had been in Langley near Slough, with the Bullfrog offices, into a new facility in Chertsey. Around August of that year the company decided to drop all further production of Bullfrog-branded products, and the former Bullfrog employees were put onto new projects such as the Harry Potter series. The last Bullfrog-branded game was Sim Theme Park (also known as Theme Park World and Theme Park 2), released in 1999.

A few compilations of older games that Bullfrog worked on have been published since, but to all intents and purposes the brand has been dead since the move to Chertsey in 2000.

Many Bullfrog developers left to found their own studios and these became Intrepid Computer Entertainment Ltd., Big Blue Box Studios Ltd. and Lionhead Studios. The latter eventually absorbed the first two and became the only studio to carry on the Bullfrog legacy.",14,

1980-12-30,Centuri,"Centuri was the continuation of the amusement machine manufacturer Allied Leisure under new leadership. Allied Leisure had been through financial difficulties towards the end of the 1970's and were bought out by the Milton Koffman family in mid-1979.

Centuri was something of an oddity in the American amusement machine business because of their location. Unlike most coin op businesses in the country, which were either located in Chicago (Midway, Williams, Stern) or on the West Coast (Atari, Sega/Gremlin, Exidy, Cinematronics) Centuri was located in Hialeah, Florida.

By the time of the Koffman takeover Allied Leisure had barely released any games since 1976/77, and what had been released had been in very limited quantities. The new owners recruited a pair of coin-op veterans to head the newly reorganized company and change its focus – Ed Miller and Bill Olliges, president and vice president, respectively, of Taito America.

Under Miller and Olliges, Centuri would largely change its focus to importing and manufacturing games from international developers. Though industry veterans today, this was among the first games by SNK, Konami and Tehkan (Tecmo) that were brought to American shores. This led to a very rapid turnaround in the company's financial situation beginning in 1981.

Centuri's turnaround would, however, not be enough for the company to escape the downturn of the arcade industry in 1983-1984. Also, by the end of 1984 Centuri's most lucrative partner, Konami, was finally establishing their own US distribution. Deprived of the source of their most successful games, Centuri would close down its video game division in 1985. The company would continue in other fields, such as housing and seafood, for a few more years until completely shuttering in 1991.",2528,

J.Y. Company is mostly known for publishing Famicom ports that were developed by Hummer Team and Ei-How Yang. These ports are often regarded as being higher quality than most other bootleg Famicom ports. Many of these ports are often released with an extra hack of itself, usually on the same PCB as the original game.

They also made a lot of multicarts, the most common are the 4 in 1. Some had more or less games but almost all of their multis don't have repeats. As well as this, many of them include late NES/Famicom releases rarely found on other multicarts such as Rainbow Islands and Mitsume Ga Tooru.

J.Y. Company hardly ever hacked other publisher's titles. From 1994 to 1998, only two titles they weren't responsible for appeared on their multicarts: Super Donkey Kong 2 and Master Fighter II.

The genesis of the studio can be traced back to the late 1990's when several colleagues working at celebrated UK game developer Rare left to form Free Radical Design. Building upon their experience of creating the genre defining GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64, Free Radical Design's debut title was the much loved TimeSplitters for the PlayStation 2. TimeSplitters 2 followed and as the studio's critical and commercial success grew, so did it's size with multiple teams working on Second Sight, TimeSplitters: Future Perfect and the PlayStation 3 exclusive, Haze.

CRYTEK UK (2009 - 2014)
At the beginning of 2009 Free Radical Design was acquired by German game developer Crytek GmbH and was re-branded to Crytek UK The studios' console development experience and multiplayer pedigree was swiftly put to use when it was drafted in to create the multiplayer game modes for Crysis 2 and also port the original Crysis to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The studio continued it's association with Crysis, moving onto production of the multiplayer modes for Crysis 3 while a second team began work Homefront: The Revolution. The Crytek UK team also contributed in a supporting role to the development of Warface and Ryse: Son of Rome.

DAMBUSTER STUDIOS (2014 - PRESENT)

Inclusivity and LGBT+ themes are always a part of our projects and we aim to create original games that take the player on an emotional journey they won't soon forget!

Boys Laugh + was founded in the summer of 2018 by Felix and Rohan. The name is an incredibly clever pun on 'boys love' or 'BL', a genre of Japanese media featuring romance, often between handsome young men, which targets a female audience. Although not exactly part of the female audience, Felix and Rohan appreciate good queer stories written with empathy. The 'boys love' genre was their first topic of discussion of many to follow about narrative games and depictions of romance and sexuality.

With due respect to the original genre, they discovered that it could benefit from an upgrade. The duo wanted to produce queer content beyond a gendered target group. Like the '+' behind LGBTQIA, for them, the '+' became a symbol of inclusivity.

As BL+ Felix and Rohan want to create interactive experiences which address diverse audiences as well as represents them. Luckily, the range of skills, each of them has, complements the team perfectly for this ambitious objective.",42310,

Rushing Pixel's game creating roots originate from the demoscene, especially the Commodore 64 platform. Back in 1997 a bunch of friends tried to create their own game called Find the Pair. Sadly this simple memory game never got to the shelves. Despite having decent graphics and digitized voice-over it was never finished. A similar story happened to their next attempt, Grubz, a Worms-clone in 2004 which even had network multiplayer support never seen on the C64 before.

Rushing Pixel's founder, Balázs 'poison' Oszvald entered the professional game industry in 2005. Among others he was involved in games like Warhammer: Mark of Chaos, Warhammer: Battle March, Crazy Taxi Fare Wars, Thunder Wolves, The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing series and Warhammer 40000: Inquisitor - Martyr. Meanwhile, multiple attempts happened to create an independent product as a side project. The most advanced example was Gemsqueezer for iOS, a logic/puzzle game that had a playable preview with 100 prefabricated levels. Ever since this game is on the to-do list.

Still possessed, in 2016 Rushing Pixel was born. The domain was registered on November 19, 2016, and Puzzle Adventure's development started. ...and 10 months later it was canceled due to lack of the ""fun factor"". The prototype of another game idea, Turn It On! proved that the development needed a completely different direction. Hopefully, players are going to agree!",16351,

Michael Peiffert was a senior art director in the web design industry. In the past, he has won several prizes for his work on user-experience and design. In 2010, he founded his one-man company, Mi Clos Studio, and began his career in the game design industry. His first game was released in 2011: Space Disorder. Michael loves Doom and is the 15th best player in France on the Xbox Live Street Fighter IV. FibreTigre has been writing interactive fiction for 12 years and has released a couple of serious/experimental games. He has written about video games in French publications, such as Wired France. FibreTigre loves turn-based games such as Gladius and X-Com and has finished both Dark Souls. Michael and FibreTigre met twice, first when Michael was pitching Space Disorder at a lecture, then when FibreTigre made a lecture about Gamebooks and their influence on modern video games. Since they both loved sci-fi, they agreed to embark on the Nomad for the Out There adventure. During Out There, FibreTigre crafted the text and the game design, whereas Michael took care about everything else: coding, art direction, graphic assets and communication. They created Out There with nearly no budget, working part time. Difficult times, but these difficulties reflected in the harsh perils and loneliness the players can experience with Out There.

1996-12-24,"Ionos, Inc","ionos Software Development and Publishing Partners, Inc. of Scottsdale, Arizona, with developers from California to Belgium, is breaking new ground in the interactive entertainment and Internet software industry. 
Headed by industry veterans and boasting a truly innovative developer relations model, ionos is the place where developers are treated as true partners throughout the product's lifespan, from development and production to marketing and sales. 
 
Nothing is more representative of its commitment to developer partnerships than ionos' unique publishing model that splits profits evenly with developers. 50/50 -- that's an unprecedented figure at this level of the industry. Match that with a sales operation focused on every known and some yet-unknown sales channels, and the result is a company focused on matching truly original titles and talent with an innovative business model. For too long, publishers have been a restrictive presence in the interactive entertainment and software industry. ionos provides the one place where developers and their ideas can move freely without resistance. 
 
Founded in 1996, ionos is headed by industry veteran Mario Vassaux. Formerly the Director of Operations for FormGen, Vassaux was part of the team that launched such notable titles as Wolfenstein: Spear of Destiny, and Duke Nukem 3D. Vassaux formed ionos after GT Interactive Software, in a multi-million dollar acquisition, purchased FormGen in 1996. Joining Vassaux at ionos is Adam Brüss. Brüss, V.P. of Sales and Marketing, has been a top marketing executive at a number of successful consumer software companies including Automap, Inc., MicroBase, and Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. 
 
ionos has been extremely busy right from the start. In February of 1997, ionos acquired Mediatechnics from GT Interactive Software, immediately gaining the profitability of the Mediatechnics division. Mediatechnics software manufacturing operation gives ionos' software publishing division increased profitability by allowing it to closely hold the line on costs and better respond to market conditions for all the products it publishes. 
 
ionos has also debuted several hot titles for the fall gaming season, ranging from the critically acclaimed funky business-simulator Zapitalism, to LEDWars, a real-time strategy title featuring top-notch Artificial Intelligence, as well as Demonstar, one of the first titles to utilize force-feedback joystick technology.",18534,

We pooled our combined 52 years of traditional games development experience, came up with great idea and by incorporating a new lean-start-up philosophy etched into our brains we were set free to innovate. 
 
We created Freejam to prove truly amazing games can be created through experimentation and evolution. The ‘founding five’ are skilled and organised professional game developers who have embraced the indie way. We are small so we can react fast, listen to our players, make quick decisions, try new stuff out and sculpt our game super efficiently. In the same unrestrained way that musicians write songs, from a simple jam session with a few chords we will create a game that grows into a masterpiece over time with support from our players… 
 
Our journey is a personal experience for the team and we will share our highs and lows with you all on our website and across social media (Facebook, Twitter and Reddit). Our approach relies on open and transparent interaction with our players – we simply can’t make this type of game without input from everyone. We don’t know where Robocraft is going to end up, nor do we know how long it will take, but to be honest that’s all part of the fun.

Kupi Key was formed in 2012, by one person, Jurica Šinko, being a little genius he is, he soon started being very successful and he realized that way more opportunities lie in making his own video games. In May 2015. he took a risk and formed Just1337 Studio, putting together 4 friends, on a mission to create their own video games, that they all so love and on who they grow up. The learning process, making the team work together, understanding what the market standards are, took about 5 months, and in October 2015 the first game was ready for release. Since then, some things of course changed and the team grow even bigger. The studio is focusing more on 2D games for now, with a big appetite to go into 3D in time. That being said, both games that this studio has behind them are 2D, each evolving in a incredible pace and complexity. Big things lay in front of us, so stay tuned.",9964,

We believe small, focused, close-knit teams can move mountains. We stay intentionally lean across-the-board: in our office space, management structure, and agile team production techniques. While we have 60+ staff spread across multiple projects, we’re prepared to leverage robust outsourcing pipelines that more than triple our internal capacity. 
 
Our teams focus on collaboration, honest and open communication, and daily sprint reviews of deliverables in progress. We strive for the same close communication and collaboration with our business and development partners. 
 
We proudly encourage our talented employees to participate in game jams, including The Workshop’s internal game jam in 2013 which led to two projects that received internal greenlights for first- (and in one case second-stage) pitch development. We firmly believe our employees are our partners, and that encouraging their creativity both inside and outside the studio makes our teams and our company stronger.

The team is famous for producing the first romance title targeting the female market in Japan, starting the trend for the Otome game genre. Members of the team are known to be predominately female, but the structure has changed over the years to include male developers. The team's name is meant to highlight the female members since rubies are considered the ""queen of gems"" and represent passionate love. 
 
Ruby Party also partakes or supervises the various media made based on their products such as the drama CDs, light novels, magazine publications, radio programs, live events, talk shows, comics, and anime. Select animated and comic adaptations have been localized overseas, but the games have largely remained in Japan —aside from a few rare exceptions. If enough interest arises for their games, there may be a chance someday they will be brought overseas and translated into English. 
 
As of April 1, 2016, Ruby Party doubles as a brand name for the company's romantic simulations, merchandise, licenses for multimedia projects, and stage event management. Mei Erikawa, Kou Shibusawa and Keiko Erikawa's eldest daughter, is the director for the Ruby Party brand.",14064,8482

The company was founded in Eugene, Oregon in 1984 by Jeff Tunnell and Damon Slye. Their first title ""Stellar 7"" was released before company founding and was later re-released with the Dynamix name on it. They made a number of games for the Commodore 64, among them Project Firestart which was one of the most atmospheric titles for the C64. 
 
In the following years, Dynamix created a line of action games for Electronic Arts, including one of the first games for the Commodore Amiga, Arcticfox. Later titles were developed for Activision. After self-publishing their games for a short while, in 1990 Dynamix was bought by Sierra On-Line. 
 
Once part of Sierra, Dynamix created some of their most famous games, including a line of adventures and flight simulations that included Red Baron and The Adventures of Willy Beamish. They also created the puzzle game The Incredible Machine, along with the spinoff Sid & Al's Incredible Toons. Another successful product line was the Front Page Sports series, designed by Pat Cook and Allen McPheeters which included Football, Baseball, and Golf. Versions of Red Baron and Front Page Sports Football were included as part of the ImagiNation Network. 
 
In 1994, the first game in a new series called Metaltech was released, a giant robot combat game with similarities to the BattleTech universe and games. This series resulted in two Earthsiege games and eventually Starsiege. As a side development of the Starsiege game, the successful Tribes series was created. Dynamix also created Outpost 2: Divided Destiny, the second game in Sierra's strategy/survival franchise, Outpost. 
 
The Dynamix studio was closed by its parent company Sierra Entertainment on August 14, 2001, as part of Sierra's restructuring under Vivendi Universal. Several veterans of the studio (including Tunnell), however, stayed in Eugene and founded a new studio / electronic publisher, GarageGames. 
 
After several years at GarageGames, Dynamix co-founder Jeff Tunnell and long-time Dynamix employee Rick Overman have founded PushButton Labs in Eugene, with the intent to further develop web-based video games. 
 
After over 10 years of retirement, Dynamix co-founder and game designer Damon Slye returned to the games industry to start Mad Otter Games in Eugene, Oregon in 2007 alongside several other key ex-Dynamix employees. Mad Otter Games released the online World War II dogfighting game Ace of Aces in 2008 on the web portal InstantAction, though after InstantAction was shut down the company revealed they would be re-releasing the game on their own website (as of August 2012 the game has not been re-released).

1981-11-30,Technos Japan,"Technōs Japan Corp. was a Japanese video game developer, best known for the Double Dragon and Kunio-kun (which includes Renegade, Super Dodge Ball and River City Ransom) franchises. As of June 2015, Arc System Works owns the intellectual properties of Technōs Japan.

Initially operating from a single-room apartment, Technōs was founded in 1981 by three staff members of Data East. Their first game was Minky Monkey, released in 1982. A few months after their foundation, a lawsuit was brought up against the company by Data East under allegations that Technos had stolen data from Data East's arcade game Pro Tennis with the intent of producing and selling a bootleg of it.[3] The two companies settled in August 1983 and Technos would go on to create two arcade games published by Data East, Tag Team Wrestling and Karate Champ. Technōs Japan's earlier games were published by other companies, as Technōs at the time did not have the economical resource to distribute their own games.

Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun (""Hot Blooded Tough Guy Kunio""), a side-scrolling beat-em-up released in 1986 about a high school student who fought thugs and delinquents from other schools, was the company's first big hit in Japan. Kunio-kun was released in the west as Renegade with the game's graphics changed to make the game marketable in the overseas market. Technōs would then produce a Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game, which would be Technōs' first game for the home console market. Technōs Japan's subsequent arcade beat-em-up, Double Dragon, was a big success worldwide when it was released in 1987, leading to the production of an NES version of the game, as well as licensed versions by other companies for various platforms.

The success of Kunio-kun led to the production of numerous spin-offs and sequels starring the same character produced for the 8-bit Family Computer platform in Japan and later for the Game Boy and Super Famicom, resulting in more than twenty games starring Kunio by the mid-1990s, many of which were rule-bending sports games. A few Kunio-kun games were localized for the North American market; namely Super Dodge Ball, River City Ransom (considered by critics to be a cult classic[citation needed]) and Nintendo World Cup, but none maintain any connection with each other. Technōs would attempt to remedy this by attempting to localize several Kunio-kun under the Crash 'n the Boys label, but only Crash 'n the Boys: Street Challenge was released (the game's ending features a teaser for Ice Challenge, which was unreleased).

Technōs also released two arcade sequels to Double Dragon: Double Dragon II: The Revenge in 1988 and Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone in 1990 (the latter was developed by an external development team at East Technology), and produced the respective NES versions of those games, as well as Super Double Dragon in 1992, an original installment for the Super NES. An American-produced Double Dragon animated series and a live-action film were also made as well.

Outside the Double Dragon and Kunio-kun games, Technōs produced a few original games for the arcade and home markets such as U.S. Championship V'Ball, The Combatribes and Shadow Force, as well as two WWF arcade games (WWF Superstars and WWF Wrestlefest), but most of these games did not achieve the same kind of success that Kunio-kun and Double Dragon achieved. The company's last games were produced for the Neo Geo hardware, which include a Double Dragon fighting game based on the movie, their second and last fighting game Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer, and a Neo-Geo sequel to Super Dodge Ball. By 1996, Technōs Japan declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. Some of the developers who worked on the Neo Geo titles (including Kengo Asai) briefly worked at Face, a former affiliate of SNK.

Following the closure, a licensing company named Million Co., Ltd was formed to purchase the former intellectual properties of Technōs Japan. Million continued to produce new games such as Super Dodge Ball Advance, Double Dragon Advance and River City Ransom EX for the Game Boy Advance, Super Dodgeball Brawlers for the Nintendo DS, as well as reissuing older titles via the Virtual Console and other services.

Shortly thereafter, Take-Two announced that Global Star's products would henceforth be sold exclusively through their Jack of All Games' sales force to strengthen the company's position in the value-priced product category. In mid 2003 Global Star Software, Inc. was formed and all distribution operations were consolidated operationally into the new company located within the Take-Two corporate facilities in New York City.

Sachen started activities in late 1988. In 1989 they released their first game, Jovial Race which was developped by a branch named Joy Van. At the end of 1989, Sachen and Joy Van merged and all subsequent games were credited to Thin Chen Enterprises or Sachen. Around 1992-3, the company started to focus on other consoles than the Famicom such as the Mega Duck and the Game Boy. Sachen stopped actively developing games around 1995-6, but a group of ex-Sachen staff continued to develop games for other publishers after this point. From 1999-2002 Sachen released four new Game Boy Color games (three of which were NES ports) which would be their final new releases. Sachen ceased activities in early 2007.

While most of Sachen's early games were original, albeit sometimes derivative, some of their later releases were unauthorised ports (such as Super Pang, Super Pang II, Gaiapolis and Mei Shao Nu Meng Gong Chang) or used assets of existing games (Samurai Spirits, Mahjong Academy, Rocman X).",1126,
